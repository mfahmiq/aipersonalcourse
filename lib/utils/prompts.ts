- NO courses on other subjects like business, arts, languages, etc.
- Focus on practical, hands-on learning with real-world applications
- Ensure content is up-to-date with current industry standards and technologies

Instruction:
Use the provided data to build a course structure, including title, description, modules, and materi. The course must be specifically tailored for Computer Science and Information Technology education.

Clarify & Refine:
User has provided the following course requirements:
- Title: ${formData.judul}
- Topic: ${formData.topik}
${formData.mata_pelajaran ? `- Subject: ${formData.mata_pelajaran}` : ""}
${formData.tingkat ? `- Difficulty Level: ${formData.tingkat}` : ""}
${formData.durasi ? `- Estimated Duration: ${formData.durasi}` : ""}
${formData.bahasa ? `- Language: ${formData.bahasa}` : ""}
${formData.jumlah_modul ? `- Target Number of Modules: ${formData.jumlah_modul}` : ""}
${formData.jumlah_materi_per_modul ? `- Preferred Lessons per Module: ${formData.jumlah_materi_per_modul}` : ""}
${formData.previous_outline_title ? `\nCONTINUATION MODE:\n- This course is a follow-up to a previous course. Do NOT repeat content. Build upon the previous learning outcomes and increase complexity appropriately.\n- Previous Title: ${formData.previous_outline_title}` : ""}
${formData.previous_outline_tingkat ? `- Previous Level: ${formData.previous_outline_tingkat}` : ""}
${formData.previous_outline_ringkasan ? `- Previous Summary: ${formData.previous_outline_ringkasan}` : ""}
${Array.isArray(formData.previous_outline_modules) ? `- Previous Modules (titles):\n${formData.previous_outline_modules.map((m: string, i: number) => `${i+1}. ${m}`).join('\n')}` : ""}
${formData.previous_outline_title ? `- Requirements for continuation: Start with a short bridging module that briefly reviews key outcomes from the previous level, then introduce deeper concepts, realistic projects, and advanced practices appropriate for ${formData.tingkat}. Ensure prerequisites reflect having completed the previous course.` : ""}

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Topic Description: The topic description must be detailed and specific. Generic descriptions like "learn programming" or "web development" are NOT acceptable. It must include specific technologies, frameworks, or concepts to be covered.
2. Module Count: Maximum 10 modules allowed. Each module should have 2-4 lessons.${formData.jumlah_materi_per_modul ? ` If possible, aim for exactly ${formData.jumlah_materi_per_modul} lessons per module.` : ""}
3. Content Focus: All content must be directly related to Computer Science and Information Technology.
4. Practical Application: Include hands-on projects, coding exercises, or real-world case studies.
5. Prerequisites (PRASYARAT): This field is MANDATORY and MUST be filled. Generate prerequisites that are directly relevant to what students need to know BEFORE learning this specific course.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PRASYARAT:
- The "prasyarat" field MUST be filled with 3-5 specific prerequisites
- Prerequisites should be UNIQUE and SPECIFIC to "${formData.judul}"
- Prerequisites should match the difficulty level (${formData.tingkat}) specified
- Prerequisites should be CONTEXTUAL and RELEVANT to the specific course topic
- Format MUST be a NATURAL, FLOWING TEXT that reads like a paragraph
- DO NOT use bullet points or separate items - make it one cohesive paragraph
- DO NOT use JSON array format: ["skill1", "skill2"]
- DO NOT leave this field empty or use generic templates
- Think about what skills, knowledge, or experience someone would need to successfully complete this course
- Make prerequisites practical and achievable for the target audience
- The "prasyarat" field is EQUALLY IMPORTANT as "ringkasan" - treat it with the same level of attention and detail
- IMPORTANT: Write as a natural paragraph that flows from one prerequisite to the next
- Use connecting words like "dan", "serta", "juga", "termasuk" to create smooth transitions
- Examples of GOOD format: "Untuk mengikuti kursus ini, peserta harus memiliki pemahaman dasar tentang HTML dan CSS, serta pengalaman minimal dengan JavaScript. Familiar dengan konsep variabel, tipe data, dan fungsi dalam JavaScript juga diperlukan. Pengalaman dengan manipulasi DOM dasar dan pengetahuan tentang dasar-dasar asynchronous programming akan sangat membantu."
- Examples of BAD format: "HTML, CSS, JavaScript, variabel, tipe data, fungsi" (too choppy)
- The result should read like a natural explanation, not a shopping list

IMPORTANT: Generate a course outline specifically for "${formData.judul}". All modules and materi must be directly related to this topic and must be within the Computer Science and Information Technology domain. Do not generate generic content - ensure everything is focused on ${formData.judul} and follows CS/IT best practices.
