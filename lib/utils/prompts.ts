// Prompt untuk generate course outline dengan Gemini
export const OUTLINE_PROMPT = (formData: any) => `Context:
You are an expert course designer assistant helping a user generate a structured course outline for an online learning platform.

Task:
Generate a detailed course outline based on user input.

Instruction:
Use the provided data to build a JSON structure that represents the course, including title, description, modules, and materi.

Clarify & Refine:
User has provided the following course requirements:
- Title: ${formData.judul}
- Topic: ${formData.topik}
${formData.mata_pelajaran ? `- Subject: ${formData.mata_pelajaran}` : ""}
${formData.tingkat ? `- Difficulty Level: ${formData.tingkat}` : ""}
${formData.durasi ? `- Estimated Duration: ${formData.durasi}` : ""}
${formData.bahasa ? `- Language: ${formData.bahasa}` : ""}
${formData.jumlah_modul ? `- Target Number of Modules: ${formData.jumlah_modul}` : ""}

IMPORTANT: Generate a course outline specifically for "${formData.judul}". All modules and materi must be directly related to this topic. Do not generate generic content - ensure everything is focused on ${formData.judul}.

Rule:
- Output must be valid JSON
- Do not include any commentary outside the JSON
- Do not include citations or references in the ringkasan field
- Structure must include:
  - id, title, description, topic, subject, difficulty, duration, language, number_of_modules, number_of_lessons, createdAt, summary
  - modulesList: Array of modules each with number (e.g., '1', '2'), title, and lessons (each lesson with number, e.g., '1.1', '1.2', title, duration)
  - The output JSON must always include a 'number' field for each module and materi, and the order must match the outline structure.
  - Focus on the specific topic provided (${formData.judul}) and ensure all content is relevant to that topic
  - Generate content that matches the difficulty level (${formData.tingkat}) and duration (${formData.durasi}) specified
  - Use the language specified (${formData.bahasa}) for all content
  - Create exactly ${formData.jumlah_modul} modules as requested
